A list of known findbugs issues that we cannot fix at this time.
For example because it requires an API change

    <!-- This bug is because com.cloudant.client.api.model.Document extends
     com.cloudant.org.lightcouch.Document. Eventually we may roll them into one class and then this
     exclude can be removed.
     -->
    <Match>
        <Bug code="Nm" pattern="NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_SUPERCLASS"/>
        <Class name="com.cloudant.client.api.model.Document"/>

    <!-- This bug is because addAttachment in com.cloudant.client.api.model.Document does not
     override the addAttachment in com.cloudant.org.lightcouch.Document. This is because of the two
     different Attachment classes. This leads to the confusing situation where there are two
     addAttachment methods on the API document class and it is hard to distinguish which to use.
     Again this can be resolved if we consolidate the Document and Attachment classes from the two
     packages.
